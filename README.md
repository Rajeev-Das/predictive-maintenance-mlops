# predictive-maintenance-mlops
Build a predictive maintenance API for ship engines, predicting Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of machinery components based on sensor data.  Dataset:  Use NASA’s CMAPSS Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Dataset (public, widely used for RUL prediction).  In your documentation, frame it as “sensor data from marine engines.”
